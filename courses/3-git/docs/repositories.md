Push to remote by giving its **alias** in our case **origin** is the alias for the remote repository:

![Push origin](images/push-origin.png)

Remote repository example:

After creating a remote repository (on e.g. Github), we navigate to our local repository and add the connection string with an alias:

```bash
sarah (master)$ pwd
/home/sarah/story-blog
sarah (master)$ git remote add origin http://git.example.com/sarah/story-blog.git
```

With remote repo alias of **origin** and remote branch **master** to push:

```bash
sarah (master)$ git push origin master
```

i.e. **git push <remote repo alias> <remote branch>**

Max created a new file and wants to get it into master:

```bash

On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        fox-and-grapes.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

max (master)$ git checkout -b story/fox-and-grapes
Switched to a new branch 'story/fox-and-grapes'

max (story/fox-and-grapes)$ git add .

Once the PR is merged, we can update locally:

![Git pull](images/git-pull.png)

Git pull is actually equivalent to **fetch and merge**:

![Git merge](images/git-merge.png)

To view all branches, both local and remote:

```bash
sarah (master)$ git branch -a
* master
  story/frogs-and-ox
  remotes/origin/master
```

Now that weâ€™ve fetched the origin `master` branch, we can update our local `master` branch with the latest changes made on **origin/master**` branch. Merge the remote `master` branch to local `master:

```bash
sarah (master)$ git merge origin/master
